I would like you to take on the role as an editor. Read the following blog post and come with concrete suggestions for improvement, also highlight things that are good. Blog post starts now:

I've lived in Germany for a long time now, it's almost 8 years by now. For the longest time I've managed to avoid learning German. At this point it feels somewhat embarrassing. Learning a new language as an adult is not easy. On top of that, when you don't come in contact with german naturally in your work environment, at home, or through friends it becomes that much more difficult to learn the language. Not to mention, in a situation like that I find myself often lacking the motivation to do the work.

Picking up vocabulary can easily be pretty time consuming, and really, in some ways I don't want to spend too much time on this. So true to an engineering mindset I'm trying to be lazy in a smart way; by using spaced repetition.

So I'm now committing to try [anki](https://ankiweb.net/) once again. In the past I've found it pretty crushing, and from what I've read I'm not alone. Lately though I've been learning kanji through the app Kanji study and the experience has been pretty delightful, so that's why I figured I should give this another try.

I think it's easy to overcommit, to try to learn words each day. So this time around I'm just going to try 10 new words every day. That's still a respectable 3600 words in a year, which should roughly be equal to the vocabulary of C1 which is rather impressive! After all, almost 8 years has gone by, what is yet another year. Being able to stick to a routine is far more important.

So what anki deck to choose..? Why, of course a deck that contains words ordered by frequency! So this [anki deck](https://drive.proton.me/urls/E33PMGWMMG#v3V4Rfg9qX3o), which is a shared deck on ankiweb, contains 5000 entries ordered by frequency. It also has example sentences and audio.

I added the audio myself using text to speech. After all, engineers love to build the tools rather than using them, don't they? Even this blog falls somewhat into that category. I've certainly spent more time coding it than writing blog posts.

In the following [repo](https://github.com/jonathan-s/anki-audio) there are some useful bits on how to edit an anki collection programmatically.

If you've read this far, I would love to hear from you if you've used anki to learn German, or perhaps if you've failed learning German using anki.

Perhaps you have any other tips or suggestions or things you'd want to share. I'd love to hear about it.
