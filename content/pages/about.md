summary: About Jonathan Sundqvist, who he is a person and many other things

This is my corner on the internet. I'll jot down thoughts and pieces of code that I find important. My intention is that it'll be useful to someone other than me. If anything I hope I'll end up at this site when I google one of my problems ;).

### What interests me

#### Webassembly
Being able to use any language to build for the biggest platform in the world, the browser, is empowering. I'm helping out to make this happen with [wasm-bindgen](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/)

#### Python
It's a beauty of a language. Reads like english and you can whip up something that works relatively quick. It's what I know best and the tool that I first tend to reach after.

#### Rust
Unlike Python, it gives you safety in knowing that your program will run once the compiler stops complaining. The lure of mastering a lower-level language brought to start picking up Rust.

#### Science-Fiction
So when I'm not reading articles on the web. I tend to read books. Of the books that I find most interesting are the science fiction books. If you're curious, you can find some of the books that I've read on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5280022-jonathan-sundqvist)

### Hire me

You're welcome to send me an email if you're looking out for my skills in a professional capacity. If you're looking to get my attention full-time, send me an email and tell me why I should work together with you. You'll get maximum 4 days a week of my time. I'm keeping the 5th day, for learning new things and contributing to open source.

### Collaborate

If you've got a project that you think would interest me, and you think I could contribute to in a meaningful way. Shoot me an email and tell why and how. Perhaps it'll be the start of something great. :)
