summary: About Jonathan Sundqvist, who he is a person and many other things

This is my corner on the internet. I'll jot down thoughts and pieces of code that I find important. My intention is that it'll be useful to someone other than me. If anything I hope I'll end up at this site when I google one of my problems ;).

I'm keeping the 5th day, for learning new things and contributing to open source.</p>

    <h3>Collaborate</h3>
    <p>

    If you've got a project that you think would interest me, and you think I could contribute to in a meaningful way. Shoot me an email and tell why and how. I'm also happy to give some feedback on something that you've been working on which you'd like a second pair of eyes on.

### What interests me

<div class="post-grid">
    <div>
        <h4>Webassembly</h4>
        <p>Being able to use any language to build for the biggest platform in the world, the browser, is empowering. I'm helping out to make this happen with <a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/" >wasm-bindgen</a></p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h4>Python</h4>
        <p>It's a beauty of a language. Reads like english and you can whip up something that works relatively quick. It's what I know best and the tool that I first tend to reach after.</p>

<div class="post-grid">
    <div>
    <h4>Rust</h4><p>
Unlike Python, it gives you safety in knowing that your program will run once the compiler stops complaining. The lure of mastering a lower-level language brought to start picking up Rust.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
    <h4>Science-Fiction</h4>
        <p>So when I'm not reading articles on the web. I tend to read books. Of the books that I find most interesting are the science fiction books. If you're curious, you can find some of the books that I've read on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5280022-jonathan-sundqvist">Goodreads</a></p>
